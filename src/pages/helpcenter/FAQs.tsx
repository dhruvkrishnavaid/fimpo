              Meet clients, finish new design work, pick up kids at school, do
              laundryâ€¦ There are just so many different tasks in work and life
              that we have to deal with on a daily basis and those tasks can
              usually change with time. It is quite handleable for our mind if
              it's just 2 or 3 tasks, but what if there are 10 or 20? Our brain
              lose focus on what's important and forget things from time to
              time. That is why you need a second-brainer app like Fimpo to help
              you free out your mind while still keeping track of everything.
              Fimpo is an application that assists you to manage your time
              better by categorizing tasks by urgency, which helps you to find
              out what is to be done next. After opening the application, click
              on the new task button in the bottom navigation drawer. Enter a
              short but appropriate title and a brief description for your task
              and tap add.
